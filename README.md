# Tabthrough

**Understand every change, one Tab at a time.**

Tabthrough turns local changes, a commit, or a commit range into an ordered walkthrough in VS Code and Cursor. Reveal the code one step at a time while the sidebar keeps the author's explanation in view. It works offline, without an account or API key.

The **Walkthrough sidebar** shows progress, the guide summary, each step's reason and full notes, and navigation and completion controls. Open it from the activity bar or **Tabthrough: Show Walkthrough**. The final step stays visible until you finish.

### Install and try

Build and sideload this release candidate:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
# Node 24 is required for the packaging toolchain.
# If you use mise: mise exec node@24 -- pnpm ext:package
pnpm ext:package
code --install-extension tabthrough-0.0.0.vsix
# Cursor users: pnpm ext:install
```

For a small, disposable example with authored notes:

```bash
node scripts/create-demo.mjs
```

Open the printed folder in your editor, run **Tabthrough: Review Working Changes**, generate or start the walkthrough, and press **Tab**. The demo walks from an order type to its calculation and caller. The script creates a new temporary repository each time; it does not change your project.

## Why ordinary diffs are hard

Git sorts by path. Explanation order is different: types before callers, schema before migration, the fix before the test that proves it. Skimming the file list is fast; finishing with a mental model is not. Tabthrough is a **guided diff reader** — it sequences the source so you form the explanation yourself. It does not find bugs, post review comments, or replace PR tools.

## Walk a change

1. Open the sidebar. The first screen lists recent commits, working changes when the checkout is dirty, and remote/branch selectors.
2. Click a commit to select it; a second click sets a range (Start/End). With nothing picked, **Review** walks the selected branch against the default base (`upstream`, else `origin`, then local `main`/`master`).
3. The header has a type selector before **Review**. It defaults to **Ask editor agent**. **Review** runs that type: agent handoff, Simple guide, Read-only walk, or Rebase. Dirty file buffers are saved before a working-tree snapshot; a failed save stops the review. Read-only does not check out or stash.
4. Read each explanation and press **Tab** (or use the sidebar) to reveal the next step.

| Mode | What it does | Landed |
|------|----------------|--------|
| Read-only | Virtual documents. Working changes get a snapshot ref; commit and range touch nothing. **Edit here** opens the real file for a working-tree review. | Yes |
| Rebase | Interactive rebase stopped at the reviewed commit. **Edit here** opens the real file. Finish amends and `--continue`; Cancel is `--abort`. | Yes |
| Worktree | Detached worktree in a new window | Later |

Alt+] and Alt+[ always advance. Ordinary Tab still indents in real file editors. Turn off `tabthrough.keybinding.useTab` to use only the alternate shortcuts. **Alt+Enter** is Edit here while a review document is focused.

Tabthrough never creates a commit for you.

## What you can review

| Command | Target |
|---------|--------|
| **Tabthrough: Review Working Changes** | Staged + unstaged + untracked (ignored files stay ignored) |
| **Tabthrough: Review a Commit…** | One commit vs its parent (palette still opens the commit picker) |
| **Tabthrough: Review a Commit Range…** | `main..HEAD` style ranges, resolved through the merge base |

The idle sidebar is the usual path: select a commit or range in the list, pick a remote branch to review a PR without checking it out, then press **Review**. Native one-click GitHub/GitLab PR lists are planned; today you choose the ref.

## Plain git underneath

Every action is a git command you could type. Read-only review does not move HEAD, stash, or lock the repository:

- Working changes: temp-index snapshot (`read-tree` / `add -A` / `write-tree` / `commit-tree`) at `refs/tabthrough/after/<id>`. Finish and Cancel delete that ref. Activation sweeps refs older than 24 hours.
- Commit and range: no write. The diff is `base..after` from objects already in the repository.
- Two windows can review the same repository at once.
- A rebase, merge, or leftover autostash started in a terminal shows in the sidebar with **Continue**, **Abort**, **Pop**, and the other named git buttons. Their stdout and stderr go to the Tabthrough output channel.

Rebase mode runs `git rebase -i --autostash` stopped at the reviewed commit. Finish is `add -u`, optional `add` of ticked untracked files, `commit --amend --no-edit`, then `rebase --continue`. Cancel is `git rebase --abort`. Worktree mode lands later. Details: [`work-docs/architecture/overview.md`](work-docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Bring the author’s intent with `.guide.json`

If a repository (or the agent that wrote the change) ships a `.guide.json`, its order and reasons replace the offline heuristic. Minimal example:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artalar/tabthrough/main/schema/guide-v1.json",
  "version": 1,
  "steps": [
    { "id": "types", "path": "src/types.ts", "rationale": "Types before callers" },
    { "id": "service", "path": "src/service.ts", "rationale": "The first consumer of those types" }
  ]
}
```

Malformed guides never block a review: every failure falls back to the heuristic with one warning. Schema: [`schema/guide-v1.json`](schema/guide-v1.json). Authoring: [`work-docs/guides/agent-guide-authoring.md`](work-docs/guides/agent-guide-authoring.md). Agent skill: [`.agents/skills/tabthrough/SKILL.md`](.agents/skills/tabthrough/SKILL.md).

| `tabthrough.session.mode`        | Which git primitive a session uses. Read-only and rebase are landed; worktree comes later.                                       | `string`  | `"ask"`                    |
| `tabthrough.finish.hooks`        | Run git hooks (pre-rebase, pre-commit, commit-msg) when starting and finishing a rebase review. Off by default.                  | `boolean` | `false`                    |

| `tabthrough.maxLinesPerStep`     | Upper bound on how many low-significance changed lines are coalesced into a single step.                                         | `number`  | `24`                       |
| `tabthrough.hideFormattingSteps` | Drop steps whose changes are whitespace or comments only.                                                                        | `boolean` | `false`                    |
| `tabthrough.worktree.dir`        | Root directory for Tabthrough worktrees. Empty uses the OS temp directory under tabthrough/.                                     | `string`  | `""`                       |

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Behaviour today |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Multi-root workspaces** | First folder’s repository only |
| **Rebase / merge / cherry-pick in progress** | Start still works; the sidebar shows git's state and the native buttons |
| **Shallow clones missing parents** | Refused with a fetch hint |
| **One-click remote PR URLs** | Planned — pick a remote branch in the sidebar today |
| **LLM-generated guides** | Planned (BYOK); default path is offline |
| **Binary / rename / mode / symlink / generated changes** | Explanation stub steps; Edit here is for text files |
| **Whitespace-only diffs** | Start refused |
| **Rebase and worktree modes** | Settings exist; Start still lands on read-only until those phases ship |
